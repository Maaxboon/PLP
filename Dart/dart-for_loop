// Dart Loop is used to run a block of code repetitively for a given number of times or until matches the specified condition. Loops are essential tools for any programming language. 

// Loops let you repeat a block of code multiple times! They are like running on a treadmill until you reach your goal. 🏃‍♂️

// Dart for loop

// The for loop is used when we know how many times a block of code will execute.

// When you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something, use a for loop.
void main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        print("This is loop iteration $i");
