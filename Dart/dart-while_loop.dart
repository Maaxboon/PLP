// The while loop is used when the number of execution of a block of code is not known. It will execute as long as the condition is true. It initially checks the given condition then executes the statements that are inside the while loop.Â 

// If you need to loop until a condition is false, use a while loop. This is like repeating a task until you're done. 

void main() {
    var list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    int i = 0; // initialize index

    while (i < list1.length) { // Loop until i is less than the length of the list
    print(list1[i]); // Print the current element at index i
    i++; // Increment the index
    }
    }
