// In Dart, the switch statement is used to evaluate an expression and execute different blocks of code based on matching cases. 

// Think of switch as a more organized if-else—

void main() {
    int day = 3;

    switch (day) {
        case 1:
        print("Monday: Let's code!");
        case 2: 
        print("Tuesday: Bless my gallery!");
        case 3: 
        print("Wednesday: We are halfway!");
        break;
        default:
        print("Time for the weekend!");
    }
}
