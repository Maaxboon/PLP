# In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. For example,

number = 10

# Here, the number is the variable storing the value 10.

# Assigning values to Variables in Python

# As we can see from the above example, we use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.

site_name = "Power Learn Project"
print(site_name)

# Changing the Value of a Variable in Python

site_name = "Power Learn Project"
print(site_name)

# Assigning new value to site_name
site_name = "ALU"
print(site_name)

# Here, the value of site_name is changed from ‘Power Learn Project’ to 'ALU'.

# Example: Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a, b, c = 5, 7, "Nairobi"
print(a) # print 5
print(b) # prints 7
print(c) # prints Nairobi

# Rules for naming variables
# snake_case
# MACRO_CASE
# camelCase
# CapWords
# Avoid using keywords
